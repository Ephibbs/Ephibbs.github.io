A friend and I run a small robotics club that grew out of our Neural Headset Quadcopter project a couple years ago for Engineering Open House. This year were are designing a art-based robotic jellyfish that flies through the air using helium and bio-inspired tentacles for locomotion. I am leading the programming team to code for lighting up the LEDs in a creative way as well as sending motion commands through a wireless transceiver. We plan to allow participants to control the glowing jellyfish, which will be covered in LEDs to simulate bioluminescence. 

More details soon...
