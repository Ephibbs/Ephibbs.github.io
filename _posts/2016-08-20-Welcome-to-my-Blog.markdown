Hello, my name is Evan. I realized that the inner workings of the human mind can be replicated by a computer algorithm. I am learning everything I can about machine learning and neuroscience to create more intelligent computers to solve complex problems. I am a student at the University of Illinois, studying computer science and physics.

I have a tenacious mind and love to ponder and experiment with ideas. I will post my projects and ideas on this blog. Please message me on linkedin if you would like to work together.
